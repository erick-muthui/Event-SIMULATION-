# Event-SIMULATION-
The basic idea behind an event simulation algorithm is to simulate the behavior of the system over time by modeling the occurrence of events that affect the state of the system. Each event is associated with a specific time stamp, and the simulation progresses by processing events in chronological order.
The algorithm typically involves the following steps:

Initialization: The system is initialized to an initial state. This may involve setting the values of various system parameters or initializing data structures that will be used in the simulation.

Event generation: The algorithm generates a list of events that will occur in the system. Each event is associated with a specific time stamp and a set of parameters that describe the effect of the event on the system.

Event processing: The events are processed in chronological order. When an event is processed, its parameters are used to update the state of the system.

Termination: The simulation ends when a specified termination condition is met. This might be a specific time limit or when a certain number of events have been processed.

Analysis: Once the simulation is complete, the results are analyzed to gain insights into the behavior of the system. This might involve visualizing the results, calculating statistics, or identifying patterns in the data.

Event simulation algorithms are commonly used in a wide range of applications, including traffic modeling, financial modeling, and engineering simulations. They provide a powerful tool for understanding complex systems and predicting their behavior under different conditions.
This is a Java program that simulates a single-server queuing system using the event-driven approach. It simulates a system with a single server that services customers who arrive according to an exponential distribution with a mean interarrival time of mean_interarrival and are served by the server for a time that is exponentially distributed with a mean service time of mean_service.

The program keeps track of various statistics such as the number of customers in the system, the waiting time of each customer, and the utilization of the server. It uses an event list to keep track of the next arrival and departure events and updates the state of the system based on the event that occurs next.

The program also handles overflow conditions in the queue, where the number of customers waiting exceeds a predefined queue limit. The program prints the simulation results to a file using a PrintWriter object.

The initialize() function initializes the system state variables and the event list. The timing() function determines the next event to occur and advances the simulation clock. The arrive() function handles an arrival event by scheduling the next arrival, checking if the server is busy, and updating the system state accordingly. The depart() function handles a departure event by decrementing the number of customers in the queue, computing the delay of the customer who is beginning service, updating the delay accumulator and scheduling the next departure event. The update_time_avg_stats() function updates the area accumulators for time-average statistics.

Note that the expon() function is not defined in this code snippet, but it is likely defined elsewhere in the program or in a separate library. It is used to generate random numbers from an exponential distribution with a specified mean.
